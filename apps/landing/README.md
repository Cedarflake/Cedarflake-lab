# Cedarflake Lab Landing

The landing app is a configuration-driven index for the projects in this monorepo. Project data, site copy, derived data, and presentation are deliberately separated so that routine catalog updates do not require component changes.

```

`projectCatalog` is the source of truth. The page derives section lists, the latest-project carousel, workbench groups, repository links, and header counts from it. Validation scans the established `apps`, `packages`, `workbench`, and `others` taxonomy so a new project directory cannot be omitted accidentally; only the landing index itself is excluded. Duplicate IDs, paths, or visible titles and invalid update dates fail with a clear error.

Every rendered project collection is ordered by `updatedAt` from newest to oldest, with the title as a deterministic tie-breaker. Workbench categories retain the order declared in `src/config/workbench.ts`, while the projects inside each category follow the shared update order.

`pnpm validate` checks catalog taxonomy, repository paths, public covers, declared PNG dimensions, canonical asset copies, site configuration, derived collection membership and ordering, stylesheet ownership, Vercel deployment configuration, the static document shell, and the server-rendered markup relationships. It runs automatically before `dev` and as part of this app's existing `check` and `build` commands; no separate CI workflow is required.

`src/styles.css` is an import-only entrypoint, ordered from low-level foundations to page-specific composition. Keep rules in the layer that owns them:

- `foundation/` must not own feature layout. It contains shared values, element defaults, accessibility helpers, and reduced-motion policy.
- `layout/` owns reusable page geometry such as the site shell and section spacing, not component appearance.
- `components/` owns each reusable UI surface together with its responsive rules. Shared card structure belongs in `components/card-shared.css`.
- `pages/` composes components for this landing page. It may position a component contextually, but must not redefine that component's base contract.

Add new imports to the matching block in `src/styles.css`; do not create cross-layer imports or return to a flat `styles/` directory.

Validation keeps `src/styles.css` import-only, requires every stylesheet to be imported exactly once, enforces the documented layer order and kebab-case filenames, and rejects nested imports. A misplaced or orphaned style file therefore fails locally instead of silently disappearing from the page.

Viewport entrance motion is opt-in through `data-reveal`. `useEntranceReveal` observes each target once and disconnects on unmount, while the shared motion stylesheet owns timing and stagger values. Keep reveal effects limited to opacity and transforms so they do not shift carousel geometry. Reduced-motion users and browsers without `IntersectionObserver` receive the final visible state immediately.

Showcase covers expose an explicit loading state: successful images fade from a soft loading treatment, while failed images become visible immediately so alternative text is not hidden. Keep intrinsic dimensions on every cover to prevent the transition from introducing layout shift.

Repository-wide brand assets remain in the root `assets/` directory. The landing app keeps deployment copies in `public/` so a Vercel project rooted at `apps/landing` is self-contained. Refresh those copies when the canonical assets change. The Hero uses a landing-owned transparent variant so its entrance animation never depends on background blending. Validation checks the configured artwork dimensions and real pixel transparency, verifies canonical-copy byte identity, and requires the favicon source to remain square.

## Add a project

Add one entry to [`src/config/projects.ts`](./src/config/projects.ts) and choose its primary `presentation`:

- `featured` places a visual project in the main project section.
- `catalog` creates a compact card in `building` or `others`.
- `workbench` places the project in a configured workbench category.

Every entry needs a unique `id`, repository-relative `path`, `title`, `summary`, `kind`, and ISO `updatedAt`. Text values must not contain surrounding whitespace. Paths use portable forward slashes without empty, `.` or `..` segments; URL-sensitive characters inside a segment are encoded automatically. By default, the card links to that path on GitHub. Add a credential-free HTTPS `externalUrl` when the preferred destination is a deployed site.

Keep the path taxonomy consistent with the entry: `app` uses `apps/`, `package` uses `packages/`, `workbench` uses `workbench/`, and `other` uses `others/`. The primary section must match that root, and a workbench project's category must match the second path segment. Validation rejects mismatches before they can produce incorrect groups or counts.

Add a `showcase` object when the project should appear in the latest-project carousel. A showcase needs a label, tags, and a real cover image with alt text and intrinsic dimensions. Any primary presentation can opt in, and the carousel includes every opted-in project without a fixed card limit. It sorts them by `updatedAt` newest first, with the title as a deterministic tie-breaker.

Put deployment-ready PNG covers in `public/covers/`. Prefer a representative project image or a 16:9 page snapshot; each showcase owns a unique cover source. Update the cover and `updatedAt` together when the visible project changes materially. Remove obsolete cover files when their project reference is removed because reused and unreferenced assets fail validation. Other formats require matching intrinsic-dimension validation before they can be added to the cover type.

No component or count changes are needed for a new project. TypeScript reports missing or incompatible fields for the selected presentation.

## Add a workbench category

Add the category once in [`src/config/workbench.ts`](./src/config/workbench.ts), then use its `key` on workbench project entries. The category type and rendered groups are derived automatically. Empty category text, duplicate keys or IDs, and project references to unknown categories fail validation.

## Change site copy

Edit [`src/config/site.ts`](./src/config/site.ts) for the locale, time zone, navigation, headings, hero copy and artwork metadata, repository commands, and footer text. Project content should remain in the project manifest. The document language, project-date formatter, and deterministic title sorting all consume the shared locale configuration. Declared hero artwork dimensions are validated against the deployed PNG and drive its layout ratio. Source links require a canonical `https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>` URL and a portable Git branch name because the catalog derives GitHub tree URLs from them.

## Development

From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev:landing
pnpm --filter @cedarflake/landing validate
pnpm --filter @cedarflake/landing check
pnpm --filter @cedarflake/landing build
```

For Vercel, set the project Root Directory to `apps/landing` and leave the install command as `pnpm install`.
